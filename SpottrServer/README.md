# Spottr Server
The SpottrServer project maintains and exposes the Spottr database. This project uses the following technologies:
 - NodeJS
 - ExpressJS
 - SQLite
 - Yarn
 - WebSockets

This project creates an empty Spottr database upon running. The server exposes RESTful-style HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for accessing and manipulating data. 

## Setup


## API Endpoints
The server uses ExpressJS as a web framework. There are several endpoints used to perform CRUD operations on the various models used in the project. Note that we are still in heavy development and the endpoints are subject to change.
